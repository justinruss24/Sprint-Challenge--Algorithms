#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
O(n) -- The driver of runtime complexity here is the number of iterations of the while loop. The loop will run nnn (or n^3) times, for an initial runtime complexity of O(n^3). Inside each loop, addition is of O(1) complexity. Multiplication of two m-digit numbers has a minimum complexity of O(n log n), so overall computation complexity will depend on the size of the values used; ignoring multiplication, though, the computational complexity is O(n^3).


b)
O(n log n) -- The outer loop here is O(n) runtime, but the inner loop is O(log n) runtime since J is growing exponentially & the loop will stop once j reaches n.


c)
O(n) -- This runtime complexity is O(n) because the number of operations will increase linearly with the bunnies input number.
